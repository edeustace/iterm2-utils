# Iterm Utils
Some iterm script utils..

# Installation

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:edeustace/iterm2-utils.git .iterm2-utils
    echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/.iterm2-utils" >> .zshrc #or do the same for bash

Note currently requires Ruby - writing the shell script was painful so I just delegated to ruby.
